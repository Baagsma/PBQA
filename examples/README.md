# Function Calling
One common usecase for LLMs is function calling. While PBQA doesn't call functions directly, using patterns, it is easy to create valid (json) objects to be used as input for tools. By combining patterns, it is easy to create an agent that can navigate a symbolic systems.

## Tool
The method `get_forecast` below uses the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) to get a forecast for a given location and time. The function takes a latitude, longitude, and time as input and returns a forecast object.

```py
import requests


def get_forecast(
    latitude: float,
    longitude: float,
    time: str,
):
    url = f"https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude={latitude}&longitude={longitude}&hourly=temperature_2m,precipitation_probability,precipitation,cloud_cover&timeformat=unixtime"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()

    target_epoch = datetime.fromisoformat(time).timestamp()
    closest_index = min(
        range(len(data["hourly"]["time"])),
        key=lambda i: abs(data["hourly"]["time"][i] - target_epoch),
    )

    return {
        "temperature": data["hourly"]["temperature_2m"][closest_index],
        "precipitation_probability": data["hourly"]["precipitation_probability"][
            closest_index
        ],
        "precipitation": data["hourly"]["precipitation"][closest_index],
        "cloud_cover": data["hourly"]["cloud_cover"][closest_index],
    }
```

## Pattern
A pattern file can then be created to ensure that the LLM generates a valid response and provide it with some examples, as can be seen in [weather.yaml](weather.yaml). PBQA uses [GBNF grammars](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/tree/master/grammars#gbnf-guide) to dictate the structure of a given pattern component. Take the `latitude` component for instance:

```gbnf
root         ::= coordinate
coordinate   ::= integer "." integer
integer      ::= digit | digit digit
digit        ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"
```

This grammar ensures that the `latitude` component is a float with a single decimal point. The `longitude` and `time` components have similar grammars.

## Agent
To use patterns, first the vector database must be initialized and the necessary files loaded. After that, the LLM can be connected to the model(s) to be queried.

```py
from PBQA import DB, LLM

db = DB(path="examples/db")
db.load_pattern("examples/weather.yaml")
db.load_pattern("examples/answer_json.yaml")

llm = LLM(db=db, host="192.168.0.137")
llm.connect_model(
    model="llama",
    port=8080,
    stop=["<|eot_id|>", "<|start_header_id|>"],
    temperature=0,
)
```

Creating a class similar to an 'Agent' can be beneficial for structuring sets of queries or patterns that are designed to accomplish specific tasks.

```py
from json import dumps
from time import strftime

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, db: DB, llm: LLM):
        self.db = db
        self.llm = llm

    def ask_weather(self, input: str):
        now = strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")
        weather_query = self.llm.ask(
            input=input,
            pattern="weather",
            model="llama",
            external={"now": now},
        )

        forecast = get_forecast(**weather_query)
        forecast = self._format_forecast(forecast)

        return self.llm.ask(
            input=input,
            pattern="answer_json",
            model="llama",
            external={"json": dumps(forecast)},
        )
```

Above, the `ask_weather` method is a tool for asking the LLM about a weather related question.

In the first query, the LLM is asked to provide a valid weather query, as defined by the [weather.yaml](weather.yaml) pattern. This query object is then passed to the `get_forecast` function to obtain the forecast response from Open-Meteo. Lastly, the forecast is [formatted](#formatting) into a json object and passed to the LLM to generate a response.

## Inference
Running the function with the input:

> Could I see the stars tonight?

First results in the following query object:

```json
{
    "latitude": 51.51,
    "longitude": 0.13,
    "time": "2024-06-19 23:00"
}
```

Then, using the `get_forecast` function, the following forecast object is generated:

```json
{
    "temperature": "13.2",
    "precipitation_probability": "0",
    "precipitation": "0.0",
    "cloud_cover": "88"
}
```

This forecast object is then [formatted](#formatting), dumped into a json string, and passed to the LLM to generate the final response:

```json
{
    "thought": "The weather doesn't look very promising for stargazing tonight. The cloud cover is quite high, which might make it difficult to see the stars.",
    "answer": "Unfortunately, the weather doesn't look ideal for stargazing tonight. The cloud cover is quite high, at 88% of the sky, which might make it difficult to see the stars. You might want to consider checking the weather forecast again or waiting for a clearer night."
}
```

As defined by the [answer_json.yaml](answer_json.yaml) pattern file, the LLM generates a response with a `thought` and `answer` component. The preceding `thought` component allows the LLM to [think](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) about the provided data before giving a final answer to improve the quality of the response.

Regarding the earlier weather query, note a specific latitude and longitude were returned by the LLM. This is the result of the examples that were provided in the [pattern](weather.yaml). Specifically, in every case where no specific location is mentioned, the example uses the longitude and latitude of London. Since the input query did not specify a location, the LLM likewise defaulted to London in this case.

This concept becomes more powerful when new examples are stored in the database, allowing the LLM to [learn](#feedback) from past interactions and provide more accurate responses in the future.

### Formatting
Before passing the forecast object to the LLM, the data from the Open-Meteo API is formatted into a more LLM-friendly json object. This is done to prevent misinterpretation of the data by the LLM as much as possible.

```json
{
    "temperature": "13.2C",
    "precipitation_probability": "0%",
    "precipitation": "0.0mm",
    "cloud_cover": "88% of the sky"
}
```

In this case, the unit of measurement is added to the temperature and precipitation values, a percentage sign is added to the precipitation probability, and the cloud cover is explicitly expressed as a percentage of the sky (as opposed to probability). Each model will have its own preferences for how data is formatted, down to whitespaces and punctuation. As such, it can be valuable to test different formatting strategies to see which one works best for a given model.
