    context_summary: "The lamp adjustment step failed due to a missing 'entity_id' parameter. The system needs the specific device identifier to control the desk lamp. The weather checking and conditional lamp color setting steps are still pending and will need to be executed after the lamp entity is identified."
  assistant:
    reflection: "The lamp adjustment failed because we don't have the specific device identifier needed to control the desk lamp. However, we can still complete the weather check and conditional color steps independently."
    course_of_action: "First check the weather in Utrecht, then determine the conditional lamp color (blue for cloudy, red for sunny). Ask the user for the lamp entity ID to complete the adjustment."
